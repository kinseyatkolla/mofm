          We will be hosting coffee hour meet and greets to answer questions
          about the City's Dissolution Plan, and will be sending out postcard
          mailings with more information. Please stay tuned to this website,
          your mailbox and our social media for details about the coffee hours
          and other opportunities to connect.

          Members of our committee are also available to talk with members of
          the community individually. Please reach out to us, we'd be glad to
          hear from you.
