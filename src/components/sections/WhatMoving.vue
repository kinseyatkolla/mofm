        <p class="section-subtitle">
          Moving on from Metro is a citizen-led issue campaign aimed to educate
          eligible voters on why a "YES" vote on the City's Plan for Dissolution
          of the Metropolitan District is best for city-wide cohesive parking,
          mobility, and downtown beautification benefitting all residents,
          business owners and visitors. On March 3rd, eligible voters in Manitou
          Springs will have the power to help put the City's Plan into action.

          The City is seeking to integrate two parking lots (Wichita and
          Smischny) and the historic Ute Pass Motel property–all properties
          currently owned and managed by the Manitou Springs Metropolitan
          District–into a cohesive city-wide parking and community engagement
          Plan to benefit residents, businesses, and visitors alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Moving on from Metro Issue Committee is asking eligible voters in
          the Metro District to vote YES for the City's Plan for
          Metro District Dissolution, which will dissolve the Metro District and
          consolidate the properties under the City's Mobility and Parking
          Enterprise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The City's Plan will streamline and unify the City's parking
          management services and provide numerous short and long-term benefits
          to residents and businesses within the district and city-wide (such as
          restoring 76 parking spaces year-round between both lots and downtown
          beautification).
