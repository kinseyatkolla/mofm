        <p class="section-subtitle">
          The Manitou Springs Metropolitan District (the District) is a
          governmental entity formed in 1989 in agreement with the City of
          Manitou Springs to support the City by acquiring parking lot
          properties and by investing in the creek walk trail. The District
          encompasses a specific geographic area of downtown Manitou Springs
          including most commercial and residential properties along Manitou
          Avenue and adjacent areas, and includes approximately 168 eligible
          voters on matters related to the District's operations. Metro
          Districts are not meant to be permanent entities. While the Metro
          District was necessary when it formed in the late 80's, the District
          has met its mission and now creates an unnecessary redundancy and a
          confusing overcomplication for parking management in Manitou Springs.

          Metropolitan districts are independent, local units of government
          granted authority through the state of Colorado that provide focused,
          specific services that are unable to be filled by other forms of
          governments. They are governed by an elected board, which, in Manitou
          Springs, includes five board members who live within and outside of
          the city limits, with several members as prominent business owners.

          The Manitou Springs Metropolitan District (the District) was created
          in 1989 initially to provide specific services, including the purchase
          of parking lots and the expansion of the creek walk trail. Later, it
          temporarily provided parking management for the City of Manitou
          Springs until it (the City) took over the management of the City's
          parking lots in 2013.

          Metro Districts are not meant to be permanent entities, and
          dissolution is a natural part of a Metro District's timeline. The
          services that the Manitou Springs Metro District was formed to provide
          in 1989 are now able to be provided fully by the City, leading to the
          need to dissolve the District to reduce inefficient and overly
          complicated redundancies in the parking infrastructure of the City.
