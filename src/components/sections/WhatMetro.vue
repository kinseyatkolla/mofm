          What is the Manitou Springs Metro District?
        </h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          The Manitou Springs Metropolitan District (the District) is a
          governmental entity formed in 1989 to support the City of Manitou
          Springs by acquiring parking lot properties and investing in the creek
          walk trail. The District encompasses a specific area of downtown
          Manitou Springs including most commercial and residential properties
          along Manitou Avenue and approximately 168 people can vote on matters
          related to the District's operations.

          Metropolitan districts are independent, local units of government
          granted authority through the state of Colorado that provide focused,
          specific services that are unable to be filled by other forms of
          governments. They are governed by an elected board, which, in Manitou
          Springs, includes five board members who live within and outside of
          the city limits, with several members as prominent business owners.

          The Manitou Springs Metropolitan District (the District) was created
          in 1989 initially to provide specific services, including the purchase
          of parking lots and the expansion of the creek walk trail. Later, it
          temporarily provided parking management for the City of Manitou
          Springs until it (the City) took over the management of the City's
          parking lots in 2013.

          Metro Districts are not meant to be permanent entities. While the
          Metro District was necessary when it formed in the late 80's, the
          District has met its mission and now creates an unnecessary redundancy
          and a confusing overcomplication for parking management in Manitou
          Springs.
