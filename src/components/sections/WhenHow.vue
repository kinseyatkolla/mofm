          Voting will happen through a special election on March 3rd. Eligible
          voters will receive a ballot in the mail. Details are still pending on
          when ballots are expected to arrive and if it will be a mail-in
          election only. We will update this site with further details.

          The Plan for Metro District Dissolution will be the only issue on the
          March 3rd ballot.
