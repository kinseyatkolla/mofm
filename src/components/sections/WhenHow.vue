          Voting will happen through a special election on March 3rd. Eligible
          voters will receive a ballot in the mail that can be mailed in, or
          dropped off (location to be determined). The Plan for Metro District
          Dissolution will be the only issue on the ballot for voters to vote on
          during this special election.
