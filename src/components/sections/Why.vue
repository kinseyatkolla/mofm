          Why is dissolution of the Metro District the solution?
        </h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">
          The mission of the Metro District has been accomplished. The City is
          well positioned to more efficiently and affordably manage parking
          infrastructure city-wide, while providing expanded parking and
          accessibility benefits.

        <p>
          The City has recently developed a comprehensive Plan to dissolve the
          Metro District and align its operations and property management into
          the City’s Transportation Master Plan. This plan was approved by a
          judge in November.
        </p>
        <p>With voter approval, the City's Plan will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            align parking rates and enforcement hours for the Wichita and
            Smischny lots with other city-managed lots, offering year-round
            monthly and annual permits to businesses and residents; free parking
            after 6 p.m.; and 50 hours of free resident parking.
          </li>
          <li>
            reinstate 76 permitted parking spots for residents and downtown
            business employees between the Wichita and Smischny lots (a public
            benefit the Metro District removed)
          </li>
          <li>
            align parking management with community priorities, including
            downtown congestion reduction and multimodal access, ultimately
            providing a better experience for downtown parking permit holders
            and visitors;
          </li>
          <li>
            reinvest funds into downtown infrastructure and beautification
            projects, as well as extension of the creek walk trail.
          </li>
          <li>
            allow residents to provide comprehensive input on the future use of
            the Ute Pass Motel property.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This approach contrasts with the District's current seasonal permit
          limitations, which restricts when residents and businesses can hold
          permits to the non-peak months of November - February; completes the
          portion of the creek walk that the District has yet to complete;
          reinvests parking revenue into downtown beautification and
          infrastructure projects that the District is unable to provide; and
          provides a proactive, actionable plan for the District-owned Ute Pass
          Motel, which was boarded up soon after the District acquired it.
